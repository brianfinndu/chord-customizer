This chord customizer does lots of things! It can help with tasks like...
- Chord ear training
- Generating a basic lead sheet
- Providing simple accompaniment

Below are some details on what each section does.

-- Saved Songs --

You can load a preexisting song by entering its number and pressing Load Song,
or remove a song by pressing Remove Song (imagine that!).

Loading a song will overwrite the current song, including the chord sheet in the
Current Song section. You can then manipulate the song as desired.

Careful - once a song is removed, there's no getting it back!

Pressing New Song will replace the current song with an empty song.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Current Chord --

In this section, you can specify a root note and octave for your chord. You can
also select the quality, an optional seventh, and the inversion.

Note that some combinations are considered "off-limits" because they aren't
sensible (like a third-inversion triad) and are automatically greyed out.

When you click "Play Chord", it will play the current chord back for you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Chord Operations --

This section draws from Current Chord section to manipulate Current Song.

Using Add Beats, you can specify how many beats of the current chord to add to
the song, in addition to where you want to add those beats. This acts like an
insert - it will push back everything that follows it. Clicking the text above
the Add Beats button will automatically provide the measure and beat numbers for
the end of the song.

Using Replace Beats, you can overwrite a specified number of beats with the
current chord. Please be cautious not to replace beyond the end of the song!

Both of these functions will automatically reformat the current song as needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Current Song --

This section houses the chord sheet for the current song.

The chord sheet can be manipulated in the Chord Operations and Song Operations
sections. It automatically formats itself based on the beats per measure, and
it indicates chords that span multiple beats with dashes.

The Tempo section can be used to adjust playback speed in beats per minute.

The Beats Per Measure section adjusts... well, the number of beats per measure.
Clicking Update Beats will reformat the chord sheet accordingly.

At the bottom, you can input a title for the song, play the entire song back,
and save the song to the server. Note that there can only be one of each song
name. This means that...

- Saving a song with the same name as an existing song will overwrite it.
- If you want to save multiple versions of one song, you need to tweak the name.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Song Operations --

This section manipulates the song in ways that do not involve Current Chord.

You can delete a specified number of beats from a chosen location using Delete
Beats. If you want to delete from the end, clicking the text above Delete Beats
will find the proper location for you.

You can also copy and paste sections of the song. This is especially helpful
for modern pop songs where chord progressions repeat often.
